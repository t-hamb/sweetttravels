				<p>Hi! We're <strong>Shannon and Talula</strong>, known on social media as Sweet T Travels. We're a traveling mom and teen duo, living full-time in our Class-C RV with our pups - <strong>Diego and Kit</strong>. </p>
			
				<p>Our full-time RV adventure started in 2015, after being inspired by a solo RVer on Instagram. We've been able to stay on our very tight budget by almost exclusively boondocking our way around the US and Canada, including AK, in our 30ft Class C motorhome. <em>60k miles and counting!</em><br><br>As a queer, fat, single mom, I have never felt more empowered. My mental health has vastly improved. My 13 year old kiddo's world is expanding as is her education, and our two pups are living their best life right along side us. On tough days, when the road life is challenging, I lean into that discomfort and welcome the gifts awaiting us on the other side.</p>
				
				<h3>Where We're Heading Next:</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Banff - Alberta, Canada</li>
					<li>Denali National Park - Alaska, US</li>
					<li>Cape Krusenstern - Alaska, US</li>
				</ol>
